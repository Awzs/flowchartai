Flowchart symbols are the building blocks of effective process visualization. Understanding these standardized shapes is essential for creating clear, professional diagrams that communicate complex processes effectively. This comprehensive reference covers all standard diagram elements defined by ISO 5807, helping you master the art of process mapping.

Whether you're documenting business processes, designing software workflows, or mapping system architectures, knowing the correct symbols ensures your diagrams are universally understood and professionally formatted.

## What Are Flowchart Symbols?

Flowchart symbols are standardized geometric shapes that represent specific types of actions, decisions, or data flow in process diagrams. These diagram elements were first standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and later adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in their ISO 5807:1985 standard.

The standardization of these shapes ensures universal understanding across teams, industries, and geographical boundaries. When you use proper diagram notation, your flowcharts communicate effectively regardless of the viewer's background or location.

### Why Standardized Flowchart Symbols Matter

Using correct diagram notation provides several key benefits:

- **Universal Recognition**: Standard shapes have consistent meanings worldwide
- **Professional Appearance**: Proper symbols create polished, credible documentation
- **Clear Communication**: Standardized elements eliminate ambiguity in process representation
- **Industry Compliance**: Many industries require standard notation for documentation

**Usage**: Specific flowchart symbol distinguishing human from automated tasks

The manual operation is one of the flowchart symbols that specifically indicates human intervention. Use this flowchart symbol to highlight steps requiring human action.

**Examples**: "Manual Review", "Physical Inspection", "Sign Document", "Quality Check"

### Predefined Process Symbol

![Predefined process flowchart symbol showing rectangle with double lines for subroutines](/images/symbols/predefined.svg)

**Shape**: Rectangle with double vertical lines
**Purpose**: Represents a subprocess or predefined routine
**Usage**: Organizational flowchart symbol for modular process design

The predefined process is one of the flowchart symbols used for hierarchical process mapping. This flowchart symbol references detailed processes defined elsewhere.

**Examples**: "Login Process", "Payment Gateway", "Error Handling", "Data Validation"

## Flowchart Symbols Best Practices

### Consistency in Symbol Usage

When working with diagram elements, consistency is paramount. Use the same shapes for similar operations throughout your diagram. This consistency makes your notation more effective and your diagrams easier to understand.

### Proper Symbol Selection

Choose the right elements for each operation type:
- Use process rectangles for actions and operations
- Use decision diamonds for conditional logic
- Use input/output parallelograms for data operations
- Use terminal ovals for start and end points

### Symbol Sizing and Spacing

Maintain consistent sizing across all diagram elements. Proper spacing between shapes improves readability and professional appearance.
