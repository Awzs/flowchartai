# How to Use Flowchart AI — Make Flowcharts Instantly from Text

Tbh, using flowchart AI is pretty simple, but when I let some friends of mine test it, they were having a lot of confusion about the interference (idk why friends are so dumb, I think that I need new friends, lol). At that point, I decided to make a complete tutorial on how to convert the text into flowcharts.

And one more thing, in the last part of this blog, I have also added my backstory that will let you know why I created this tool and how I wasn't satisfied with the other tools in the market. Or if you are more excited about that, then click on the button below, and it will take you to my story. Hope you're gonna love that!

## 3 Simple steps to create flowcharts using AI:
As I have already told you that using the flowchart AI tool isn't rocket science. That's why I have divided the whole process into 3 simple steps as follows:
1. Giving a prompt
2. Let Flowchart AI do its magic
3. Exporting the flowchart
Let's get deep into these steps before I start boring you ;)
### 1\. Giving a prompt
A prompt is the text-based instructions that you give to AI to get the answer you want. So some people use detail prompts to make flowcharts, and some create simple ones at the start and then make them complex manually or by using an AI chatbot.
Okay, to make things clearer, I will use an example prompt to give you the best demonstration of the tool. I will be using 'Make me a flowchart on how to make intelligent friends' as a prompt because that's what I need the most, kidding.

Okay, as I have added the prompt in the box, and now I will click on the next arrow button to send this prompt to AI.
That was the first step of our tutorial. If you want to add more detailed prompts, then you can use ChatGPT or any other tool to make a detailed prompt.

**Expert Tip:**
Make sure to proofread the prompt before clicking the Arrow button.

### 2\. Let Flowchart AI do its magic:
after clicking the arrow button, you will be taken to the Canvas page. This is the work station of the website that will let you make flowcharts, edit them and then export them.
This is the result i got from my prompt:

Pretty cool, huh? And all this result was generated within a second.
Let me tell you best part, our AI also asks you some questions to get better results. I put this feature in the tool because sometimes we don't know what we need, so it will help to give you more clarity and precise flowcharts.

### 3\. Export Your Flowchart:
This is the last step of the whole process. In this step, you will export the flowchart. You just need to click on the hamburger icon in the top left corner and then choose the export option that fits you most, and then save it to the desired folder.

And following is the flowchart I have generated and exported using Flowchart AI:

## **What Makes Flowchart AI Different**
Let's be honest, there are dozens of flowcharts in the market and they are also doing pretty well. But most of those websites are treating flowcharts as a side chick. They just want to bring traffic from all sources, and they don't care about how well their AI is working. On the other hand, we are specialists just in flowcharts, and we are regularly upgrading our charts to your needs.
Here’s the difference at a glance:

| Feature | Traditional Tools | Flowchart AI |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Requires design skills | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Generates from text | ❌ | ✅ |
| Converts images | ❌ | ✅ |
| AI-powered editing | ❌ | ✅ |

It’s not magic, but it’s the **smartest way to simplify complex ideas fast.**
Once you try it, you’ll never want to go back to drawing boxes manually again.
## **The Story Behind Flowchart AI — Why This Tool Exists**
Let’s talk about _why_ Flowchart AI was built in the first place.
Although there are already tools on the market, none felt like a true **flowchart agent**, one that lets you create and edit clear, professional diagrams just from normal text as you are talking to your friend who actually knows how to make a flowchart in seconds.
Most tools still expect you to understand formatting, layouts, or even basic programming. That’s fine if you’re a designer or engineer, but for most of us, it’s just friction.
Here’s the real story:
People shouldn’t have to learn _another_ system to explain a simple process. When inspiration hits, you should be able to _describe_ what you mean and see it visualized instantly.
That’s the whole idea behind Flowchart AI.
> “AI should handle the understanding and drawing work, so you can focus on the creative and valuable part.”
And that’s exactly why Flowchart AI was built, and the basic purpose was to make flowcharts effortless.
