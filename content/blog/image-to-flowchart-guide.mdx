# Convert Image to Flowchart (Complete Guide)

## Reason Why Introduce Image to Flowchart Feature:
A while back, I had a homework assignment in which I had to make flowcharts from the images. I wouldn't say images were some fancy charts, but they were some rough screenshots and pics captured from a whiteboard. Sounds simple, right? Except for the part where I had to go through each image individually and manually create the flowchart. Yeahâ€¦ not fun.
I spent hours Googling "how to convert images into flowcharts magically" (as AI wasn't introduced back then). None of the results were according to my needs, and none of them not a single one was able to convert an image to a flowchart. Fast forward to today, and Iâ€™m excited to say thereâ€™s finally a tool that does exactly what I wished for back then. It can **convert images into fully editable flowcharts**â€”and it does it like a charm. No more manual labour or endless hours of copy-pasting and re-drawing.
In this **complete guide**, Iâ€™m going to walk you through how to use this awesome tool to take any imageâ€”whether it's a **whiteboard photo**, **screenshot**, or even a hand-drawn sketchâ€”and turn it into a professional, editable flowchart in no time. Letâ€™s get started and save you some headaches!
## Step-by-Step Guide from image to flowchart:
I am using the following 3 images that I will convert into flowcharts using FlowchartAI.

I will convert them into flowcharts in the following simple steps:
1. upload the image
2. Press Arrow Button and Your Flowchart is Ready
3. Export Your Flowchart
Let's dive deep into each step and see how well it works.
### 1\. Upload the image:
Okay, so first you need to upload an image. Either click on the "Upload image" option or drag and drop the file into the upload box. Following is the screenshot that shows complete details:

That's all for this step. If your image is easy to read, then skip the optional Note, but if you want some customization or want AI to act in a certain way, then give it a prompt.
### 2\. Press Arrow Button and Your Flowchart is Ready:
After uploading the image, click the arrow button and let AI activate. FlowchartAI will generate the flowchart in a matter of seconds.

FlowchartAI will tell you what it thinks about the image and what it's doing to keep you updated. This lowers the chances of mistakes and restricts AI from hallucinating.
As you can see, the results are perfect and we don't need to make any more changes in it. But if you want to make it more attractive, then just tell FlowchartAI to do it, and it will be done.

The following are the results I get. FlowchartAI has even marked the processes that are going around in the flowchart to give the user more clarity. I suggest you try it every time after exporting the flowchart to save the progress.

This flowchart is entirely editable. You can do it manually or by using AI. I suggest adopting a hybrid approach, where significant changes will be made by AI, and minor adjustments will be made by you.
### 3\. Export Your Flowchart:
Flowchart AI gives you different options to export the flowchart. To export, click the Export button in the top right corner of the Canvas page.

## Summing Up Everything:
Let's be honest, the days of painstakingly creating flowcharts manually from images are over. Whether it was a whiteboard photo, a classroom screenshot, or a rough hand-drawn sketch, the process used to be a source of endless frustration, taking hours of redrawing, arranging boxes, and connecting arrows. But not anymore.
Thanks to AI, the transformation of visuals into structured, editable diagrams is now lightning-fast and incredibly accurate. With tools like **FlowchartAI**, you can **convert an image to a flowchart** in a matter of seconds â€” no more guesswork, no more wasted time.
