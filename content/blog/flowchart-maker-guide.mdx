# Introduction 

“Flowchart maker” is searched **tens of thousands of times every month**—Ahrefs alone shows **17 K U.S. monthly searches** for the term, pushing it into the top keywords for diagramming sites like diagrams.net.  [Ahrefs data](https://ahrefs.com/websites/diagrams.net)
That steady demand signals two clear reader needs:

1. *Which tool should I pick?*  
2. *How do I create a diagram quickly (ideally, with help from AI)?*

This guide tackles both questions and closes with a step-by-step tutorial using **FlowChart AI**—our own AI-powered maker.

## What Is a Flowchart Maker? 

A *flowchart maker* (sometimes called a diagramming tool) is software that lets you drag, drop, and connect standardized symbols—Start/End, Process, Decision, etc.—to visualize a workflow or system. The symbols themselves have been standardized by ANSI/ISO since 1985.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart)

Early solutions like Microsoft Visio were desktop-only; modern makers are browser-based, collaborative, and increasingly **AI-assisted**.

## Choosing the Right Flowchart Maker 

1. **Define your use case** – system design, business process, UX flow, etc.  
2. **Collaboration needs** – do teammates need real-time editing?  
3. **AI vs. manual control** – prefer full automation or pixel-perfect tweaking?  
4. **Compliance & data residency** – especially for regulated sectors.  
5. **Export / API hooks** – will diagrams live in Docs, Slides, Confluence, GitHub?

## Tutorial ➜ Build Your First Diagram with **FlowChart AI**

1. **Open the editor** at [flowchartai.org](https://flowchartai.org/) and sign in.
2. **Enter a prompt** —  User browses site → adds item to cart → checks out → payment success / failure
3. **AI generates** a clean flowchart; nodes are auto-spaced and labeled.  
4. **Refine** by dragging shapes or asking, *“Add email receipt step after payment success.”*  
5. **Export** to Excalidraw (now) or PDF/PNG (road-mapped for Q4 2025).
6. **Share** via public URL or embed snippet.

You’ve built a production-ready diagram in under two minutes—no manual drawing required.

## Advanced Tips & Tricks

* **Import Mermaid** code → let AI restyle it automatically. (Great for dev docs.)
* Use **keyboard shortcuts** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to regenerate layout).  
* Feed **requirements docs** into the prompt to auto-generate end-to-end flows.  
* Version-control diagrams by exporting JSON to GitHub ([draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/faq/offline) & [FlowChart AI](https://flowchartai.org/) both support this).
