# How to Make a Flowchart in Google Docs

If you want to make a flowchart in Google Docs, you have three reliable options:

- Make a flowchart in Google Docs with built-in Drawings (shapes & connectors)
- Make a flowchart in Google Docs by inserting a linked Google Drawings file (update from source)
- Make a flowchart in Google Docs using add-ons (Lucidchart, diagrams.net/draw.io)

This step-by-step guide shows each method and when to use it. All instructions are verified against Google Help pages.

## Option 1 — How to make a flowchart in Google Docs using built-in Drawings

Best for: simple flowcharts inside a Doc page without external tools.

Google references
- Docs Editors Help — Learn how to use drawings & markups: https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179740?hl=en

Steps
1) Insert a new Drawing dialog
- Docs > Insert > Drawing > New

2) Add flowchart shapes
- In the Drawing toolbar, click Shape > Shapes > pick Flowchart shapes (Terminator, Process, Decision, Data)
- Click to place and type your step text

3) Connect shapes correctly
- Click Line > choose a Connector (Arrow, Elbow connector, or Curve)
- Drag from a shape edge until you see connection points; connect to the next shape
- Style arrowheads/line weight via the Line formatting controls

4) Align and tidy up
- Use Arrange > Align and distribute to keep spacing consistent
- Use Fill color and Border color to establish a visual system (e.g., Decisions as diamonds with a distinct color)

5) Save and edit later
- Click Save and Close to insert the drawing in your Doc
- Double-click the drawing to re-open and edit

Pros
- Native and quick; no add-ons
- Connectors anchor to shapes so your flowchart stays connected while moving shapes

Cons
- Manual layout; limited auto-routing for complex flows
- For large diagrams, editing inside the small dialog can feel constrained

## Option 2 — How to make a flowchart in Google Docs via linked Google Drawings (update from source)

Best for: maintainable or larger flowcharts with the ability to refresh updates from source.

What it is
- Create your flowchart in Google Drawings (standalone)
- In Docs, Insert > Drawing > From Drive to place a linked version; later edits in Drawings can be pulled into Docs with Update

Google references
- Docs Editors Help — Learn how to use drawings & markups (From Drive and link to source are documented): https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179740?hl=en

Steps
1) Build your flowchart in Google Drawings
- Use shapes, elbow connectors, and formatting in a full-size canvas

2) Insert the linked drawing into Google Docs
- Docs > Insert > Drawing > From Drive > pick your drawing, and keep it linked

3) Update from source when your flowchart changes
- Click the drawing in Docs; if updates exist, click Update to refresh

Pros
- Full-size canvas for easier editing
- Linked updates keep your Doc in sync with the source drawing

Cons
- Requires a separate Google Drawings file
- Linked objects rely on Drive access; collaborators need permissions to edit the source

---

## Option 3 — How to make a flowchart in Google Docs with add-ons (Lucidchart, diagrams.net/draw.io)

Best for: complex flowcharts, auto‑layout, collaboration, export to PNG/SVG/PDF.

What you can use
- Lucidchart Diagrams add-on: insert and sync diagrams into Docs
- diagrams.net (draw.io) add-on: create and insert diagrams

Generic steps
1) Install the add-on from Google Workspace Marketplace
2) Open the add-on sidebar in Docs, select an existing diagram or create one
3) Insert the diagram image into your Doc

Pros
- Better auto-routing and diagramming features
- Robust export options and collaboration

Cons
- Some add-ons require external accounts or paid plans for advanced features
- Inserted content is often an image snapshot (refresh depends on the add-on)

## Which Google Docs flowchart method should you choose for making a flowchart in Google Docs?

- “I need a quick flowchart in Google Docs”: choose **built-in Drawing**
- “I need maintainability and easy updates”: choose **Linked Google Drawings**
- “I need complex layouts and exports”: choose **Add-ons** (Lucidchart, diagrams.net)

## Practical examples

Create a basic Google Docs flowchart via Drawing
1) Insert > Drawing > New
2) Add Shapes: Start (Terminator) → Process → Decision (diamond)
3) Use Elbow connector lines to branch Yes/No to next steps
4) Save and Close; double-click later to edit

Insert a linked Google Drawings flowchart into Docs
1) Create a flowchart in Google Drawings (Drive > New > More > Google Drawings)
2) In Docs: Insert > Drawing > From Drive; pick your drawing and keep it linked
3) After editing the source drawing, click Update in Docs to refresh

Use an add-on (generic)
1) In Docs, Extensions > Add-ons > Get add-ons; search “Lucidchart” or “draw.io/diagrams.net”
2) Launch the add-on, create/select your flowchart, and Insert

## FAQ: Google Docs flowcharts (verified)

- Can I connect shapes properly in Google Docs?
  - Yes. In the Drawing dialog, use connector lines (Arrow/Elbow/Curve) so lines anchor to shapes. Source: Google Help (Drawings in Docs)

- Can I keep a flowchart updated across documents?
  - Yes. Build it in Google Drawings and insert it as a linked drawing in Docs. Click Update to pull latest changes. Source: Google Help (Insert from Drive)

- What if I need advanced diagram features?
  - Use add-ons like Lucidchart or diagrams.net for auto‑layout, rich export, and collaboration. Insert the result into your Doc.

## Troubleshooting: Google Docs flowchart issues

- Connectors don’t stick to shapes
  - Use connector lines (Arrow/Elbow/Curve) from the Line menu so endpoints snap to shape anchors. Avoid plain lines when building a flowchart in Google Docs.

- Canvas feels too small for complex flowcharts in Google Docs
  - Build the diagram in standalone Google Drawings and insert it as a linked drawing (From Drive). Click Update in Docs when the source changes.

- Add-ons content won’t refresh
  - Many add-ons insert static images. Check if the add-on supports refresh/sync; otherwise, prefer the linked Google Drawings method for maintainability.

- Collaborators can’t edit the source flowchart
  - Linked drawings require Drive permissions. Share the Google Drawings file with the right access level to enable updates.


## Conclusion: The best way to make a flowchart in Google Docs

For small and quick tasks, use **Drawings** directly inside Google Docs. For maintainability and larger diagrams, **build in Google Drawings and insert as a linked drawing** so you can update from source. If you need robust diagramming, **use an add-on** and insert the diagram into your Doc. Either way, your Google Docs flowchart stays close to project context and is easy to share.
