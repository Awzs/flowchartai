# Feature Toggle Control System

## Implementation (2025-06-16)

### 1. Configuration-Based Feature Control
- ✅ Added `enableDocsPage` feature toggle in `src/config/website.tsx`
- ✅ Added `enableAIPages` feature toggle in `src/config/website.tsx`
- ✅ Added `enableMagicUIPage` feature toggle in `src/config/website.tsx`
- ✅ Added `enableBlocksPages` feature toggle in `src/config/website.tsx`
- ✅ Extended `FeaturesConfig` type definition in `src/types/index.d.ts`
- ✅ Set docs page to disabled by default (`enableDocsPage: false`)
- ✅ Set AI pages to disabled by default (`enableAIPages: false`)
- ✅ Set MagicUI page to disabled by default (`enableMagicUIPage: false`)
- ✅ Set blocks pages to disabled by default (`enableBlocksPages: false`)

### 2. Route-Level Control
- ✅ Implemented `notFound()` check in `src/app/[locale]/docs/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Implemented `notFound()` check in `src/app/[locale]/(marketing)/ai/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Implemented `notFound()` check in `src/app/[locale]/(marketing)/(pages)/magicui/page.tsx`
- ✅ Implemented `notFound()` check in `src/app/[locale]/(marketing)/blocks/[category]/layout.tsx`
- ✅ Docs pages return standard 404 when feature is disabled
- ✅ AI pages return standard 404 when feature is disabled
- ✅ MagicUI page returns standard 404 when feature is disabled
- ✅ Blocks pages return standard 404 when feature is disabled
- ✅ SEO-friendly approach - pages truly "don't exist" when disabled

### 3. Navigation Control
- ✅ Modified `src/config/navbar-config.tsx` for conditional docs link display
- ✅ AI navigation links already commented out in navbar
- ✅ MagicUI navigation links already commented out in navbar (in blocks menu)
- ✅ Blocks navigation links already commented out in navbar
- ✅ Modified `src/config/footer-config.tsx` for conditional docs link in footer
- ✅ No AI links found in footer (confirmed clean)
- ✅ No MagicUI links found in footer (confirmed clean)
- ✅ No blocks links found in footer (confirmed clean)
- ✅ Links only appear when respective features are enabled

### 4. SEO and Sitemap Control
- ✅ Updated `src/app/sitemap.ts` with dynamic route generation
- ✅ Docs pages excluded from sitemap when feature is disabled
- ✅ AI pages excluded from sitemap when feature is disabled
- ✅ MagicUI page excluded from sitemap when feature is disabled
- ✅ Blocks pages excluded from sitemap when feature is disabled
- ✅ Search engines won't discover disabled pages

### 5. Technical Implementation
- **Dual Control Strategy**: Route-level blocking + Link-level hiding
- **Zero Code Deletion**: All page files remain intact
- **Configuration Driven**: Single toggle controls entire feature
- **SEO Optimized**: No 404 errors affecting search rankings

### 6. Current Status
- 🔒 **Docs Feature**: DISABLED (`enableDocsPage: false`)
  - ❌ Navigation links hidden
  - ❌ Footer links hidden  
  - ❌ Direct access returns 404
  - ❌ Excluded from sitemap
  - ✅ Code files preserved

- 🔒 **AI Features**: DISABLED (`enableAIPages: false`)
  - ❌ Navigation links hidden (already commented)
  - ❌ Direct access to /ai/* returns 404
  - ❌ Excluded from sitemap
  - ✅ Code files preserved
  - ✅ Covers all AI pages: text, image, video, audio

- 🔒 **MagicUI Feature**: DISABLED (`enableMagicUIPage: false`)
  - ❌ Navigation links hidden (already commented)
  - ❌ Direct access to /magicui returns 404
  - ❌ Excluded from sitemap
  - ✅ Code files preserved
  - ✅ Single showcase page with multiple UI components

- 🔒 **Blocks Features**: DISABLED (`enableBlocksPages: false`)
  - ❌ Navigation links hidden (already commented)
  - ❌ Direct access to /blocks/* returns 404
  - ❌ Excluded from sitemap
  - ✅ Code files preserved
  - ✅ Covers all blocks categories: hero-section, features, pricing, testimonials, etc.

### 7. Usage
To enable docs feature:
```typescript
// src/config/website.tsx
features: {
  enableDocsPage: true,  // Enable docs functionality
}
```

To enable AI features:
```typescript
// src/config/website.tsx
features: {
  enableAIPages: true,   // Enable AI functionality
}
```

To enable MagicUI feature:
```typescript
// src/config/website.tsx
features: {
  enableMagicUIPage: true,   // Enable MagicUI functionality
}
```

To enable blocks features:
```typescript
// src/config/website.tsx
features: {
  enableBlocksPages: true,   // Enable blocks functionality
}
```

To disable features:
```typescript
// src/config/website.tsx
features: {
  enableDocsPage: false, // Disable docs functionality
  enableAIPages: false,  // Disable AI functionality
  enableMagicUIPage: false,  // Disable MagicUI functionality
  enableBlocksPages: false,  // Disable blocks functionality
}
```

This system can be extended to control any page or feature in the template while maintaining code integrity and providing excellent SEO performance.
